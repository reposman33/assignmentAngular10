# FedEx Web Coding Challenge

## Description

- Write a web app that uses the GIPHY image search API and shows the results (you can
use API key CdRKiCMbTnt9CkZTZ0lGukSczk6iT4Z6).
- The app must let users enter queries, such as “puppies".
- The app must contain a filter on search input. The search should not allow swear
words.
- The app must support pagination.

## Browser support
- Assume ES6 support, do not worry about old browsers.

## Language and framework choices
- Use the latest version of Angular in combination with TypeScript.
- UX/UI can be based on Bootstrap or Material (or do it yourself with minimal effort)

## Priorities
1. A working production-ready app.
2. Clean code and application architecture.
3. A README covering how to run your project.

## How we review
Your application will be reviewed by two of our engineers. We take your experience level into
consideration. The aspects of your code we will assess include:
- Correctness - Does the application do what was asked? If not, does the README explain

## why it is missing and/or different?
- Code quality - Is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Are there any
code smells? Is the coding style consistent with the Angular style guide?
- Testing - Is your logic covered with unit or integration tests?
- UX - Is the web interface understandable and pleasing to use?
- Technical choices - Are choices of libraries, architecture etc. appropriate for the
chosen application?

Good luck!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
